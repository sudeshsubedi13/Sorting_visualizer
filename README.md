# **Sorting Visualizer**

This is the visualizer I made for sorting algorithm while learning
sfml.

### **Algorithms**
1. Bubble sort
2. Quick Sort

### **Dependencies**
1. SFML

### **Building**
Before building make sure you have sfml installed and its include files is available for your compiler

first clone the repo into desired location

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sudeshsubedi13/Sorting_visualizer.git
```

then run the install.sh file
```sh
source install.sh
```

the executable is in builds/sorting relative to current path


### **NOTE**
Code needs refactoring to make sorting algorithms
functions of Sort class rather than child classes of Sort
